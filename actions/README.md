# Actions

* action and reaction
* actor and reaction
* intent and effect

## Action and reaction

For every input action there may be an output of none to multiple actions; but idealy at least one action for a success or failure, or multiple actions for status.

## Actor and reaction

A reaction produces actions; we could define a reaction that produces an action every one second.

An Actor is a reaction, but it produces an output of actions as response to input actions.

## Intent and effect

Examples of intent in a request:

* Simple request with a single action
* Request with single intent action with subsequent effect actions
